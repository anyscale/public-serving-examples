# FastAPI and Ray Serve Integration: Design Pattern

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a design pattern for integrating FastAPI with Ray Serve that prioritizes separation of concerns and supports full FastAPI functionality.

## Design Goals

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keep FastAPI code separate from Ray Serve implementation
   - Enable teams to work independently on their respective components

2. **Team Structure Support**
   - FastAPI teams can build routes, endpoints, and handlers without deep Ray Serve knowledge
   - Ray Serve teams can develop deployments as callable services 
   - Infrastructure teams can manage the integration layer

3. **Full FastAPI Feature Support**
   - Support the complete FastAPI feature set without limitations
   - Demonstrate seamless integration with Ray Serve

4. **Integration Demonstration**
   - Showcase practical patterns for calling Ray Serve Deployments from FastAPI endpoints

## Supported FastAPI Features

| Category | Description | APIs/Plugins |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Core API Features** | | |
| Define Endpoints | HTTP endpoints for inference/health checks | `@app.get`, `@app.post`, `@app.put`, `@app.delete` |
| Request Validation | Input validation and output serialization | Pydantic models |
| Metadata | Parameter enrichment for docs/validation | `Query()`, `Path()`, `Header()`, `Cookie()` |
| Dependency Injection | Shared resource injection | `Depends()` |
| Request/Response Access | Headers, status codes, cookies | `Request`, `Response` |
| Streaming | Stream inference results | `StreamingResponse` |
| WebSockets | Real-time communication | `@app.websocket` |
| **App Lifecycle** | | |
| Middleware | Global logic (logging, CORS, metrics) | `@app.middleware("http")` |
| Event Handlers | Startup/shutdown hooks | `@app.on_event()` |
| Background Tasks | Post-response jobs | `BackgroundTasks` |
| Exception Handlers | Consistent error handling | `@app.exception_handler()` |
| **Architecture** | | |
| Modular Routes | Organized endpoints | `APIRouter` |
| API Versioning | Backward compatibility | Path prefixes, versioning libraries |
| **Security** | | |
| Authentication | Endpoint security | OAuth2, JWT libraries |
| Access Control | Role-based restrictions | Custom logic with `Depends()` |
| **Observability** | | |
| Metrics & Tracing | Performance monitoring | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus |
| Logging | Request and application logs | Python logging + middleware |
| **Performance** | | |
| Caching | Response/model result caching | Redis, caching libraries |
| Rate Limiting | Request frequency control | Rate limiting libraries |
| **Model Management** | | |
| Model Registry | Model versioning and retrieval | MLflow, cloud storage, Hugging Face |
