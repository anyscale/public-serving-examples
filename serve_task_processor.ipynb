    "# Async Task Processing in Ray Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve customers need a way to handle long-running API requests asynchronously. For example, when a user requests video or document indexing, the system should enqueue the task in a background queue for later processing. The API should return a quick response while the task executes asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traditional Solution and Its Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is to use a message broker to queue tasks and a stream processor to handle them asynchronously. However, this introduces complexity for customers who lack the infrastructure for online stream processing, requiring them to manage and scale additional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"stream_processor.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For Anyscale customers using Ray Serve, we propose hosting **Celery Workers as Ray Serve Deployments**. Since Celery supports various message brokers (e.g., SQS, Redis, RabbitMQ), users can bring their own message brokers for async task queuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach slightly deviates from Ray Serveâ€™s original request-response model by enabling it to support long-running stream processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"serve_stream_processor.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Ray Tasks within a Deployment Handler**  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "indexing_worker.remote(video_id, \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ray is designed for distributed task execution, this approach fails because the indexing_worker task would share fate with the MyApp deployment. During service rollouts, Ray's garbage collection may cancel in-progress tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building a Custom Stream Processor**\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a custom solution to support multiple message brokers would require significant effort. Celery already provides this functionality, making it the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status\n",
    "Support for Celery within Ray Serve is experimental, and recommendations may evolve. This document serves as an initial exploration of the approach."

    "## Caveats, Considerations, and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Delivery Guarantees Depend on the Message Broker**  \n",
    "   - Different message brokers offer varying guarantees. For example, **SQS provides strong delivery guarantees**, whereas **Redis does not**.  \n",
    "   - Refer to the [Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/) for broker and backend choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **At-Least-Once Processing Is Configuration Dependent**  \n",
    "   - At-least-once processing in Celery depends on configuration parameters like:  \n",
    "     - `task_acks_late`  \n",
    "     - `task_acks_on_failure_or_timeout`  \n",
    "     - `task_publish_retry`  \n",
    "     - `task_publish_retry_policy`  \n",
    "   - By default, Celery **does not guarantee at-least-once processing**. See [Celery FAQ](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/faq.html#faq-acks-late-vs-retry) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TaskProcessor Deployment Should Only Contain Celery Tasks** *(Recommendation, Not a Strict Requirement)*  \n",
    "   - This simplifies future autoscaling, as task processor scaling can be based purely on queue characteristics.  \n",
    "   - Mixing API routes in `TaskProcessor` could complicate autoscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Including TaskProcessor in Deployment Chains**  \n",
    "   - There is **no need** to include `TaskProcessor` in any deployment chain since Celery tasks are invoked using:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     celery_app.send_task(\"document_indexing_task\", args=(document_id,))\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "   - This remains true until we find a way to support:  \n",

    "5. **Celery Workers Run Inside Ray Actors** *(Key Design Choice)*  \n",
    "   - Running Celery workers **inside Ray actors** ensures Ray manages their lifecycle, preventing zombie processes if an actor dies.  \n",
    "   - However, this limits the Celery execution pool to **threads**. See [Celery Worker Pools](https://celery.school/celery-worker-pools) for available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concurrency Considerations**  \n",
    "   - **For I/O-intensive tasks:** Increase Celery worker concurrency.  \n",
    "   - **For CPU-intensive tasks:** Increasing thread concurrency **wonâ€™t help** due to the **GIL**. Instead, increase `num_replicas` on `TaskProcessor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Celery Tasks That Call Other Deployments May Be Bottlenecked**  \n",
    "   - If a Celery task invokes another Ray Serve deployment, **its concurrency is limited** by the `max_ongoing_requests` of the target deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Status Tracking of Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "When tracking the status of asynchronous tasks queued in Celery, users have two options:  \n",
    "- **Using Celery Task ID:**  \n",
    "   Obtain the Celery task ID from `celery_app.send_task` and use `celery_app.AsyncResult(celery_task_id)` to poll for task status.  \n",
    "- **Custom Status Tracking:**  \n",
    "   Generate a unique task ID, store it in a database, and update the task status in the database when execution completes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between these approaches depends on the application's requirements. Since this falls outside the immediate scope of Ray Serve, we currently do not provide built-in status tracking. However, future support may be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Backward and Forward Compatibility of Tasks During Application Rollouts**\n",
    "\n",
    "During an **up-then-down** deployment, where two versions of a task processor run concurrently, compatibility issues may arise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices for Version Rollouts**  \n",
    "- **Drain Pending Tasks Before Upgrading**  \n",
    "   Before starting Celery workers with a new application version, ensure that all tasks enqueued by the old version have been processed. If tasks remain in the queue and the new version modifies the task definition incompatibly, they may either:  \n",
    "     - Remain unprocessed in the queue.  \n",
    "     - Be incorrectly routed to an unintended task.\n",
    "   Ray serve does not guard against this, recommendation to user is not make such drastic change to the app. The only thing serve ensures is that, when a deployment actor is shutting down, it will do best effort to stop accepting new tasks and all ongoing tasks are completed before it shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Stable Data Serialization**  \n",
    "   To safeguard against backward and forward compatibility issues, use structured encoding formats like **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** or **Avro** for task parameters and return values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Persistence Considerations**  \n",
    "The duration a task remains in the queue depends on the **message broker configuration** and whether an `expires` value was set when the task was enqueued. By default, if no workers are available, tasks can sit in the queue indefinitely. This is particularly important when an application rollout **removes a task handler**, as unprocessed tasks may be left in an orphaned state.\n",

    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, this solution is **DIY**, but future improvements should aim for deeper integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Move `TaskProcessor` Into Ray Serve**  \n",
    "   - Reduce boilerplate by abstracting Celery setup from users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enable Autoscaling for Celery Workers**  \n",
    "   - Implement autoscaling based on queue depth and processing load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Harden the system for failiure conditions**\n",
    "   - when app rollout, do we loose messages in queue?\n",
    "   - what happens during replica fail over?"
