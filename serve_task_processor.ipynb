    "# Async Task Processing in Ray Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve customers need a way to handle long-running API requests asynchronously. For example, when a user requests video or document indexing, the system should enqueue the task in a background queue for later processing. The API should return a quick response while the task executes asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traditional Solution and Its Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is to use a message broker to queue tasks and a stream processor to handle them asynchronously. However, this introduces complexity for customers who lack the infrastructure for online stream processing, requiring them to manage and scale additional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Task Processing Architecture](./stream_processor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For Anyscale customers using Ray Serve, we propose hosting **Celery Workers as Ray Serve Deployments**. Since Celery supports various message brokers (e.g., SQS, Redis, RabbitMQ), users can bring their own message brokers for async task queuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach slightly deviates from Ray Serveâ€™s original request-response model by enabling it to support long-running stream processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Task Processing Architecture](./serve_stream_processor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Ray Tasks within a Deployment Handler**  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "indexing_worker.remote(video_id, \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While Ray is designed for distributed task execution, this approach fails because the indexing_worker task would share fate with the MyApp deployment. During service rollouts, Ray's garbage collection may cancel in-progress tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building a Custom Stream Processor**\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a custom solution to support multiple message brokers would require significant effort. Celery already provides this functionality, making it the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status\n",
    "Support for Celery within Ray Serve is experimental, and recommendations may evolve. This document serves as an initial exploration of the approach."

    "## Caveats, Considerations, and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Delivery Guarantees Depend on the Message Broker**  \n",
    "   - Different message brokers offer varying guarantees. For example, **SQS provides strong delivery guarantees**, whereas **Redis does not**.  \n",
    "   - Refer to the [Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/) for broker and backend choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **At-Least-Once Processing Is Configuration Dependent**  \n",
    "   - At-least-once processing in Celery depends on configuration parameters like:  \n",
    "     - `task_acks_late`  \n",
    "     - `task_acks_on_failure_or_timeout`  \n",
    "     - `task_publish_retry`  \n",
    "     - `task_publish_retry_policy`  \n",
    "   - By default, Celery **does not guarantee at-least-once processing**. See [Celery FAQ](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/faq.html#faq-acks-late-vs-retry) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TaskProcessor Deployment Should Only Contain Celery Tasks** *(Recommendation, Not a Strict Requirement)*  \n",
    "   - This simplifies future autoscaling, as task processor scaling can be based purely on queue characteristics.  \n",
    "   - Mixing API routes in `TaskProcessor` could complicate autoscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Including TaskProcessor in Deployment Chains**  \n",
    "   - There is **no need** to include `TaskProcessor` in any deployment chain since Celery tasks are invoked using:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     celery_app.send_task(\"document_indexing_task\", args=(document_id,))\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "   - This remains true until we find a way to support:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     document_indexing_task.delay(document_id)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Celery Workers Run Inside Ray Actors** *(Key Design Choice)*  \n",
    "   - Running Celery workers **inside Ray actors** ensures Ray manages their lifecycle, preventing zombie processes if an actor dies.  \n",
    "   - However, this limits the Celery execution pool to **threads**. See [Celery Worker Pools](https://celery.school/celery-worker-pools) for available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concurrency Considerations**  \n",
    "   - **For I/O-intensive tasks:** Increase Celery worker concurrency.  \n",
    "   - **For CPU-intensive tasks:** Increasing thread concurrency **wonâ€™t help** due to the **GIL**. Instead, increase `num_replicas` on `TaskProcessor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Celery Tasks That Call Other Deployments May Be Bottlenecked**  \n",
    "   - If a Celery task invokes another Ray Serve deployment, **its concurrency is limited** by the `max_ongoing_requests` of the target deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, this solution is **DIY**, but future improvements should aim for deeper integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Move `TaskProcessor` Into Ray Serve**  \n",
    "   - Reduce boilerplate by abstracting Celery setup from users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enable Autoscaling for Celery Workers**  \n",
    "   - Implement autoscaling based on queue depth and processing load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automate Celery Task Registration**  \n",
    "   - Remove the need for users to manually register Celery tasks.\n"
